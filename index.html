            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Kim is the real dealâ€”transparent and fearless in addressing the issues 
                that haunt you and keep you awake at night. 
                With 25 years of experience in the addiction field and a decade focused 
                on trauma and PTSD, Kim creates a safe space for you and your peers to unburden yourselves, 
                reminding you that you are not alone and no longer have to suffer.

                Trained in EMDR, Kim employs this technique alongside other evidence-based therapies
                 to challenge the negative core beliefs formed in childhood and reinforced by trauma 
                 and substance abuse. She is dedicated to fostering a positive belief system through
                  acceptance, self-care, and compassion for yourself and others.</p>
